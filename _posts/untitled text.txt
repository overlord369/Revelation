I smiled gazing at the moon
An epiphany occurred: Rose are made of diamonds
Besides a diamond a flower bloomed
A diamond will cherish the mood
but a flower cannot cure the gloom
What's more valuable?
A crippled lifeless diamond or ...
An alive and exuberant rose which blooms in the morning and withers by the evening
Love is like a fresh fragrant breeze that enters the home, fills it with freshness and fragrance, remains there as long as existence allow it, then moves out.
If you close all the doors the same breeze will become absolutely stale
In life everything is changing and change is beautiful
It gives you more experience, more awareness and more maturity

You bestow the vivacity of a rose; full of exuberance and euphoria
Like a moonlight solacing the existence with luminance
Thinking of you teleports me to Atlantis
Nothing fancy, just ordinary things about you
Right perspective converts stones into sermons
You're like an antidote who blows away the melancholy 
I don't want possessions:
If you love a rose, don't pluck it.
Love is not about possession, it's about appreciation
With a little faith, just a little trust 
if you believe in love, it can move mountains
An alchemy which can turn anything into gold like a Midas touch
Whenever I wanna quit, your thought keeps me going
You strengthen my endurance and keep me disciplined
The glimmer on your face is breath taking
The simplicity of your being is magnanimous 
The vivacity of your soul is just par excellence!
It makes my intuition whispers, it's you!
