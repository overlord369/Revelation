### <u>“Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.”</u> 

*― Babe Ruth*

Babe Ruth exhibits his triumphant philosophy through this prodigious statement.

### <u>Every legend was once a beginner.</u> 

What makes them different is their perseverance and dedication. Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep. Pain will last for a minute or day. But if we quit it will last forever. Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep. We give up easily and we don't climb our way towards the epitome.

<u>I have heard an interesting anecdote:</u>

A manager of a Multi National Company took his group of employees to a golf course, where he introduced them to a virtuoso Golfer.

He made them watch him perform. He had a bunch of golf clubs ,bats, pool sticks, anything you can think of that would be long and could be used to hit a golf ball. Out in the course were markers at 25/50/75/100 yards on out to about 300 yards. This man went through a half hour display of hitting golf balls to these markers and landing every ball within about 2 feet of the marker. Hundreds of balls without fail. He was an absolute magician and could drive 300 yards, perfectly straight with a putter and hit a golf ball 100 yards (or to any marker) with a baseball bat just as well. It was unbelievable.

After this impressive display, the sales manager told the employees that he paid him $20,000.00 in cash to do that 30 minute show and paid for all of his expenses as well. 

The showman told the employees the following:

------

*"I bet you're wondering how I am so good at hitting golf balls and how I can command such a high price for this short display of my talents. It's not that I am a gifted golfer. I don't have a great score on the course when I play an actual game. It's not that I have natural talent. It took me a very long time to get good at these things. It's just that I wake up every day and do the following:*

*I hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a break, hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a lunch, hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a break, and hit golf balls for 2 more hours and finish for the day."*

------

His simple point was that he gave 100% of his time to his job for those short bursts of time and didn't waste his time at all while he was working at his job. That's the secret. 

In a time where it is so easy to think that you are sneaking by with minimal work and still getting paid while you waste time on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and drag yourself into mediocrity... 

But, someone who is applying himself, 100% of the time is supposed to get ahead in life. You can be that person, if you live your live courageously and engrossing yourself into your work.
