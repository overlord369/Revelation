&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;― Babe Ruth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babe Ruth exhibits his triumphant philosophy through this prodigious statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/babe_ruth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;babe_ruth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;every-legend-was-once-a-beginner&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Every legend was once a beginner.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes them different is their perseverance and dedication. Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep. Pain will last for a minute or day. But if we quit it will last forever. Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep. We give up easily and we don’t climb our way towards the epitome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;I have heard an interesting anecdote:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A manager at a Company took a group of his employees to a golf course, where he introduced them to a virtuoso Golfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made them watch him perform. He had a bunch of golf clubs ,bats, pool sticks, anything you can think of that would be long and could be used to hit a golf ball. Out in the course were markers at 25, 50, 75, 100 yards on out to about 300 yards. This man went through a half hour display of hitting golf balls to these markers and landing every ball within about 2-feet of the marker. Hundreds of balls without fail. He was an absolute magician and could drive 300 yards, perfectly straight with a putter and hit a golf ball 100 yards (or to any marker) with a baseball bat just as well. It was unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this impressive display, the sales manager told the employees that he paid him                  $ 20,000 in cash to do that 30 minute show and paid for all of his expenses as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The showman told the employees the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I bet you’re wondering how I am so good at hitting golf balls and how I can command such a high price for this short display of my talents. It’s not that I am a gifted golfer. I don’t have a great score on the course when I play an actual game. It’s not that I have natural talent. It took me a very long time to get good at these things. It’s just that I wake up every day and do the following:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a break, hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a lunch, hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a break, and hit golf balls for 2 more hours and finish for the day.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His simple point was that he gave 100% of his time to his job for those short bursts of time and didn’t waste his time at all while he was working at his job. That’s the secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time where it is so easy to think that you are sneaking by with minimal work and still getting paid while you waste time on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and drag yourself into mediocrity…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, someone who is applying himself, 100% of the time is supposed to get ahead in life. You can be that person, if you live your live courageously and engrossing yourself into your work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rohit Naidu</name></author><summary type="html">“Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/09/24/man-must-explore/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest" /><published>2014-09-24T17:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2014-09-24T17:30:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2014/09/24/man-must-explore</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2014/09/24/man-must-explore/">&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
