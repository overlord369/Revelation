&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;― Babe Ruth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babe Ruth exhibits his triumphant philosophy through this prodigious statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/babe_ruth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;babe_ruth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;every-legend-was-once-a-beginner&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Every legend was once a beginner.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes them different is their perseverance and dedication. Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep. Pain will last for a minute or day. But if we quit it will last forever. Most of you don’t want success as much as you want sleep. We give up easily and we don’t climb our way towards the epitome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;I have heard an interesting anecdote:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A manager at a Company took a group of his employees to a golf course, where he introduced them to a virtuoso Golfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made them watch him perform. He had a bunch of golf clubs , bats, pool sticks, anything you can think of that would be long and could be used to hit a golf ball. Out in the course were markers at 25, 50, 75, 100 yards on out to about 300 yards. This man went through a half hour display of hitting golf balls to these markers and landing every ball within about 2-feet of the marker. Hundreds of balls without fail. He was an absolute magician and could drive 300 yards, perfectly straight with a putter and hit a golf ball 100 yards (or to any marker) with a baseball bat just as well. It was unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this impressive display, the sales manager told the employees that he paid him                  $ 20,000 in cash to do that 30 minute show and paid for all of his expenses as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The showman told the employees the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I bet you’re wondering how I am so good at hitting golf balls and how I can command such a high price for this short display of my talents. It’s not that I am a gifted golfer. I don’t have a great score on the course when I play an actual game. It’s not that I have natural talent. It took me a very long time to get good at these things. It’s just that I wake up every day and do the following:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a break, hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a lunch, hit golf balls for 2 hours, take a break, and hit golf balls for 2 more hours and finish for the day.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His simple point was that he gave 100% of his time to his job for those short bursts of time and didn’t waste his time at all while he was working at his job. That’s the secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time where it is so easy to think that you are sneaking by with minimal work and still getting paid while you waste time on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and drag yourself into mediocrity…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, someone who is applying himself, 100% of the time is supposed to get ahead in life. You can be that person, if you live your live courageously and engrossing yourself into your work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rohit Naidu</name></author><summary type="html">“Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Master &amp;amp; A Disciple</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/self-help/2017/06/08/A-Master-&-A-Monk/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Master &amp; A Disciple" /><published>2017-06-08T17:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-06-08T17:30:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/self-help/2017/06/08/A%20Master%20&amp;%20A%20Monk</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/self-help/2017/06/08/A-Master-&amp;-A-Monk/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;Don't insist upon your own fixed ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
 If your mind is broad it can easily embrace the entire world.&quot;&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;- Zen Proverb&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A master is who broadens the vision and strengthens the endurance of a disciple. A master inculcates the discipline essential for the intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a subtle difference between a teacher and a guru. Teacher is just a profession and guru is a way of living. Teacher is of the west and a guru is of the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship between guru and disciple is intimate like love&lt;/strong&gt;. The reverence that is felt is like love but one difference: love is parallel and reverence is one above the other. Love creates friendship, because the lover and the loved one are on the same level. Reverence is also a kind of love but with a great difference: it is not on he same level, one person is higher. If there’s loving intimacy with the personality above, the reverence is not expected or demanded, but it is automatically created around the guru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guru is not aware of his guru-ship. A guru cannot claim that he is a guru. A guru has attended the condition of egolessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The relationship between the disciple and the guru is a relationship of intimate trust.&lt;/strong&gt; That doesn’t mean blind faith, because the guru never expects you to believe in him — that is not an expectation.  Guru is always saying, “Jump into it! Do it!” But before you can jump, trust is needed or you will not jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverence for a teacher is not possible. It is forced, artificial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a guru, it happens automatically in the mind of the disciple. It’s the charisma of the guru which attracts the disciple like gravity. A teacher is knowledgeable but a master is intuitive and meditative. A teacher is ingrained with machine-like monotony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even concepts such as beauty are not totally expressible&lt;/strong&gt; 
If you have seen a flower, you can say it is beautiful. But that does not convey anything. Your words never convey the actual realization of the moment because they can mean anything to the person to whom they are conveyed. A person who has never seen beauty in any flower will hear your words and understand the meaning of them without understanding anything at all, because the word beauty does not mean anything to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some indispensable revelations implied in the following poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Ma'am.png&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; style=&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 20px&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/moon.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; style=&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 20px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Baskerville font-size: 24px&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You're a master and I'm your disciple,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Not an instructor not an authority to order&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But a master who observes, envelopes and loves his disciple&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The wrath of your grandeur is calamitous&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conventional wisdom is superficial&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But your eccentric approach is altruistic&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The way you teach is fabulous&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The time spent in your lectures is eternal,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Time ceased with each of your insightful revelation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Your talks are esoteric elevating me to the epitome of bliss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Its my honor to be a disciple of a guru like you.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You make me feel bliss and get totally engrossed in learning too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
